# Self-hosted AI Package


### What‚Äôs included

‚úÖ [**Self-hosted n8n**](https://n8n.io/) - Low-code platform with over 400
integrations and advanced AI components


‚úÖ [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) - Cross-platform LLM platform to install
and run the latest local LLMs

‚úÖ [**Open WebUI**](https://openwebui.com/) - ChatGPT-like interface to
privately interact with your local models and N8N agents


### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
 docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.private.yml --profile gpu-nvidia up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
 docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.private.yml --profile gpu-amd up -d
```

### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you're using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU:
   ```bash
    docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.private.yml --profile cpu up -d
   ```

2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the n8n instance:
   ```bash
    docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.private.yml --profile none up -d
   ```

   If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the [Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/) for installation instructions.

#### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable in the n8n service configuration. Update the x-n8n section in your Docker Compose file as follows:

```yaml
x-n8n: &service-n8n
  # ... other configurations ...
  environment:
    # ... other environment variables ...
    - OLLAMA_HOST=host.docker.internal:11434
```

Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: http://localhost:5678/":

1. Head to http://localhost:5678/home/credentials
2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

### For everyone else

```bash
 docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.private.yml --profile cpu up -d
```



## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start and usage

The main component of the self-hosted AI starter kit is a docker compose file
pre-configured with network and disk so there isn‚Äôt much else you need to
install. After completing the installation steps above, follow the steps below
to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You‚Äôll only
   have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with n8n in the setup here,
   it is only a local account for your instance!
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/vTN9y2dLXqTiDfPT>
3. Create credentials for every service:
   
   Ollama URL: http://ollama:11434

   Postgres: use DB, username, and password from .env. IMPORTANT: Host is 'postgres'

  
   Don't use localhost for the redirect URI, just use another domain you have, it will still work!
   Alternatively, you can set up [local file triggers](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.localfiletrigger/).
4. Select **Test workflow** to start running the workflow.
5. If this is the first time you‚Äôre running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.1. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.
6. Make sure to toggle the workflow as active and copy the "Production" webhook URL!
7. Open <http://localhost:3000/> in your browser to set up Open WebUI.
You‚Äôll only have to do this once. You are NOT creating an account with Open WebUI in the 
setup here, it is only a local account for your instance!
8. Go to Workspace -> Functions -> Add Function -> Give name + description then paste in
the code from `n8n_pipe.py`

   The function is also [published here on Open WebUI's site](https://openwebui.com/f/coleam/n8n_pipe/).

9. Click on the gear icon and set the n8n_url to the production URL for the webhook
you copied in a previous step.
10. Toggle the function on and now it will be available in your model dropdown in the top left! 

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.
To open Open WebUI at any time, visit <http://localhost:3000/>.



## Upgrading

To update all containers to their latest versions (n8n, Open WebUI, etc.), run these commands:

```bash
# Stop all services
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml --profile <your-profile> down

# Pull latest versions of all containers
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.yml --profile <your-profile> pull


Replace `<your-profile>` with one of: `cpu`, `gpu-nvidia`, `gpu-amd`, or `none`.
